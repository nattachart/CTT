Carbon Track and Trace aims to develop an automated system that enables cities and the like to get direct feedback on their GHG emissions,
as well as automating the GHG reporting. For further reading, please visit http://www.carbontrackandtrace.com/.

This repository is used for all code associated with the project, mainly code to be used for the hardware we are deploying within our
network.
